> **Abstract.** This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for data lying in hyperbolic spaces. Given directions, PCA relies on: (1) a parameterization of subspaces spanned by these directions, (2) a method of projection onto subspaces that preserves information in these directions, and (3) an objective to optimize, namely the variance explained by projections. We generalize each of these concepts to the hyperbolic space and propose HoroPCA, a method for hyperbolic dimensionality reduction. By focusing on the core problem of extracting principal directions, HoroPCA theoretically better preserves information in the original data such as distances, compared to previous generalizations of PCA. Empirically, we validate that HoroPCA outperforms existing dimensionality reduction methods, significantly reducing error in distance preservation. As a data whitening method, it improves downstream classification by up to 3.9% compared to methods that don’t use whitening. Finally, we show that HoroPCA can be used to visualize hyperbolic data in two dimensions.

The code has an implementation of the HoroPCA method, as well as other methods for dimensionality reduction on manifolds, such as Principal Geodesic Analysis and tangent Principal Component Analysis.

### Examples

#### 1. Run HoroPCA on the smalltree dataset:
```
python main.py --dataset smalltree --model horopca --dim 10 --n-components 2
```
Output: 
```
distortion: 	0.19 +- 0.00
frechet_var: 	7.15 +- 0.00
```

#### 2. Run Euclidean PCA on the smalltree dataset:
```
python main.py --dataset smalltree --model pca --dim 10 --n-components 2
```
Output: 
```
distortion: 	0.84 +- 0.00
frechet_var:    0.34 +- 0.00
```
